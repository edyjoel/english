# GERUNDS (ING verbs as activities)
is a form of a verb that ends in -ing that is used as a noun.
Also a way to refer to a verb as an activity.
Has the same principle as INFINITIVE VERBS

# 1. As the subject of the sentence
The subject of the sentence is THE ACTIVITY

Practicing skydiving is very risky sport
Finding a good job is not a easy task
Studying for your exam is boring
swimming each week is my favourite sport

# 2. As the object of the sentence

# 3. Used after the verb "GO" (only idioms)
Idioms are specific expression for a language
go shopping is astrid;s favorite hobby

# 4. Negatives sentences (using not)
All of the above with "not" before.
